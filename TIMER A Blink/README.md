# TIMER A Blink
In this lab, we are using the TIMER module instead of a software loop and was able to control the rate of two LEDS blink. The code utilizes two timer interrupts. For Timer0, the speed of the LED is set to be 5Hz while in Timer1 the speed of the LED is set to 10Hz. The only difference for the two boards are the usual. For FR6989, the default high impedence is disabled and the LED setup is different from G2553.
